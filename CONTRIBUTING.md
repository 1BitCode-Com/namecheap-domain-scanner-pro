Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Set up
1. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Create `config.local.yaml` from `config.yaml` and keep secrets out of git.

## Development
- Use `--dry-run` for safe testing.
- Prefer small, focused PRs.
- Describe the change, motivation, and testing notes in the PR.

## CI
GitHub Actions will compile sources and run a quick dry-run scenario.
